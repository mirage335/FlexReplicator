Advanced multi-tool desktop factory based on OpenRail.

Intended to simultaneously operate multiple milling, laser, extrusion (FDM 3D Printing), and inkjet (powder 3D printing, 2D coloring) tools. Simulations indicate deflection should be 8mm/metricTon of lateral force.

Preview release, still in development.

See render.png for assembly overview, or download free eDrawings viewer for further investigation.

Total cost is around $1k, plus <$100 in tools, 3D printed parts, and belts.

__FutureWork__
Openbuilds has intriguing ACME high-pitch threaded rod actuators. Future versions of the FlexReplicator may use these if the belts prove inadequate. Belts are slightly preferred for speed during laser-rastering.

OpenBuilds has discontinued hardcoat aluminum rails in favor of polycarbonate wheels. While little if any performance degradation is expected, these substitutions need to be reflected in CAD model materials and BOM data.

Supply chain issues are common to many parts in the BOM, secondary suppliers should be added.
